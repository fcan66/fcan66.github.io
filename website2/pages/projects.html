					<h3>The Community Technology Center (CTC) is a facility that provides free computer access and training to people without a computer or internet in their home. 
				    In the Native American worldview, a CTC is a place where parents and guardians as well as their children find 
				    a space to meet their educational technology needs, be informed of therapeutic services, receive
				    cultural services, obtain foster parent certification, and acquire advocacy. In addition, the CTC plans 
				    to host community meetings and welcome visitors interested in connecting with the Native American community. The main objective of CTC is to provide support and tools for the family and community. <img class = "textwrap" src="../images/coffee.png" align = "right" width = 50> </h3>
